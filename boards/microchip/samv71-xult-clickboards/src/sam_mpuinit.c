 * Name: board_mpu_nocache_init
 *
 * Description:
 *   Configure the MPU to mark the dedicated DMA buffer region as non-cacheable.
 *   This must be called from board init AFTER the NuttX MPU has been initialized
 *   and enabled, as we're adding an additional region.
 *
 ****************************************************************************/

  /* Configure the 64KB region at the end of SRAM (0x20450000) as
   * Normal, Shareable, Non-Cacheable memory.
   *
   * CRITICAL FIX: Use a hardcoded HIGH region number (14) to ensure priority
   * over the default SRAM region (usually Region 2 or 3). Using mpu_configure_region()
   * allocates the next available region (likely 0), which would be overridden
   * by the default cacheable map, rendering this configuration useless.
